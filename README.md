## About Campground

### user Guide
- This is the app similar to actual YelpCamp app, the user can post their experience on campgrounds they visited and share to the world!
- If the users wants to edit or post their campground there are some restrictions (explains below). If the user is simply looking, no requirements are needed
- This app has few restrictions when editing/changing campgrounds/comments for security purposes:
    1. Users must register their account
    2. User must log in
    3. Only the SAME user account can edit/delete their campgrounds and comments (if any user can delete or edit campgrounds, there is no point!)
- The app has authorization function in order to avoid unwanted users to modify any comments or campground

### Purpose
- The purpose of this app is to sharpen the skills for FULL STACK Development.
